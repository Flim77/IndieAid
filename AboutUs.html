    <h2 class="bigger left">Our Story</h2>
    <p>The founders, Thomas Edward Kern and Shelby Farrel McCurnin, had started out in a Videogame and Design Tech Center, and realizing the injustice against Modern Indie Developers, had stepped up to fight for the cause. Indie Aid, based out of Richmond, VA, is a Non Profit organization dedicated to helping fund and bring underprivileged or underrepresented indie developers and games to the limelight so they can earn the public recognition and support they deserve.

    <h2 class="bigger left">Our Message</h2>
<p>Our Message, as a Non Profit organization, is to not only help individuals make a kickstarted career in Video Game development, but to make an effort to change the industry. Helping the “Little guy” in the competitive market of Video Games to ensure they do not only run out of money, but faith in their line of work. <br><br>
    The changes we wish to bring to the larger scale industry is simply quality of life. Glass windows to the public about game development and what to expect from the build, and open communication from developers, engineers, and designers in the department which the game is being worked on. <br><br>
    The video game industry is awfully closed for as long as it's been around for. The same few corporations have dominated the industry's standard of quality, and have been producing the same few games for decades. The lack of diversity between the workloads of these developers can lead to burnout and a feeling of hopelessness, constantly slaving away on the same old projects. We feel strongly about how developers should be treated in the modern workplace, and that is why Indie Aid is working to provide for Indie Developers in the modern climate of Game Development.

    <h2 class="left" id="P">Publishing</h2>
<img src="Images/publishing.jpg" alt="kid playing on a tablet" class="pubImg">
<p>  As it is an expensive process for those with small incomes to get your game published (And meet other requirements), we use some of our donations to help these indie developers get their game out into the public. Although some studios or solo developers can fully develop and publish their works on their own via their own means, some may be using Indie Aid to upload a passion project, where they dont have the spare income to shell out money to upload something they can’t completely rely on.

<p>   Since the ability to get a game running on multiple platforms and on a variety of computers is dire to expanding your playerbase and the playability of your game. Indie Aid assists developers in branching out their connections, so ex-developers or developers willing to sherpa novice or learning developers in their quest to realize their ideas into the publics hands.

<h2 class="left" id="F">Funding</h2>
<img src="Images/funding.jpg" alt="piggy bank with coins nearby" class="pubImg">
<p>Since many of these indie developers aren’t paid for their work on these projects until after it’s released - unlike larger studios with the money to burn - Indie Aid puts money aside for these developers to spend more time working on their personal projects and, eventually, turn this development into a full working and paying job. This funding can come from small to large donations - from the public and developers alike to begin setting up their own teams and studios, to focus on their work and passion.

<p> Through Indie Aid, small developers can not only Advertise themselves through Indie Aid, but through our Social Medias, and through other developers that are a part of Indie Aid.

<h2 class="left" id="D">Development</h2>
<img src="Images/Developement.jpg" alt="group of people all working on a laptop" class="pubImg">
<p>As some solo developers find themselves being undermanned for larger projects, Indie Aid has found that having a system to have developers that are currently not working, or want an opportunity to try and help or assist a new project get off the ground, have the ability to do so. This can lead to solo developers finding new devs to work with, and can even form their own studio if they decide to consistently work with one another. Indie Aid is especially keen on these opportunities, as developers working together with the same goals in mind can lead to larger projects, larger communities, and eventually, these solo developers can cause a ripple in the colossal pool that is the gaming industry.
